This repository will come to include various processing sketches.

At the moment, this repository only includes three classes belonging to a starling murmuration simulation sketch done in Processing 3.
The bird class determines the flight behavior of each bird in relation to one another.
The flock class determines the size of the starling flock
The garden class includes other visual aspects of the simulation including buildings trees and a sky that changes color.
